# fastBCKP
      This is a Bash script that automates the process of backing up a specified directory.
• fastBCKP.sh for linux based systems
• fastBCKP.bat for windows based systems

      You choose whether or not to encrypt the backup archive with a password, and you can also choose whether or not to upload the backup archive to a remote location (remote server)

Just run the script (be shure to use "sudo/run as admin" if you want to backup the one of the root/Admin directorys or OWNED BY ROOT/Admin)
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
HERE YOU GO, YOUR BACKUP IS READY NOW

PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, THOUGHTS, IDEAS or PROBLEMS related with the script.

      p.s. if there is any problem while running just remove the banner part ;)
